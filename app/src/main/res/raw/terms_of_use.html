<b>Terms of Use</b>
<br>
<br>
By downloading or using the pqCode application (
<b>the App</b>), you agree to use the App and
the
service it provides between users (
<b>Customers</b>) and vendors (
<b>Vendors</b>) (
<b>the
    Service
</b>) in
accordance with these terms of use (
<b>the Terms</b>)

<br>
<br>
You agree not to copy, or modify the App, any part of the App, or the pqCode trademarks in any
way. You agree not to attempt to extract the source code of the App, nor to translate the App
into
other languages, or make derivative versions. The App itself, and all the trade marks,
copyright,
database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, belong to pqCode Ltd.
We are committed to ensuring that the App is as useful and efficient as possible. For that
reason,
we reserve the right to make changes to the App or to the pqFee, at any time and for any reason,
but which will be reflected here in the Terms of Use.

<br>
<br>
The pqFee is charged on all transactions at a rate of 10%, and as a Customer using the App with
any participating Vendor you agree to pay the pqFee, which is not refundable in any
circumstances. Participating Vendors may, as part of their discretion to pay any refunds,
include
the pqFee as part of any such refund.

<br>
<br>
The App stores and processes personal data and payment information that you have provided, in
order to provide the Service. It is your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the App
secure. We recommend that you do not jailbreak or otherwise modify the software of your phone
to circumvent restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your
device.
The App does not always require an active internet connection for Customers, but in order to use
the Customer version of the App without an internet connection, the Customer’s individual
pqCode (QR code) must be up to date. Any data charges incurred by you on your device are
your sole responsibility. By using the App, you accept responsibility for any such charges,
including roaming data charges if you use the App outside of your home territory without turning
off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the App, we
assume and you warrant that you have received permission from the bill payer to incur any
charges through the App, either in data charges or by use of the Service.
pqCode Ltd, its employees agents or representatives accept no liability for any loss, direct or
indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app and
liability
for such loss is entirely excluded.
